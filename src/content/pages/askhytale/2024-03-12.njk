<div class="question">
<h1>Answer</h1>

<p class="ask-body">"While Hytale will definitely feature the incredible, beautiful, and mind-blowing creations we're hoping our amazing players will make with our tools, you can rest assured that there will also be plenty of original adventures, game modes and surprises from the team. The story of Orbis isn't going to tell itself, after all... Our plan is to develop the ability for you to create your own worlds and stories, and then to use those abilities to create *our own* worlds and adventures as well."</p>
